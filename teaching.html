    <h3>Design, Cultures, and Creativity | <em>Teaching Assistant, 2017</em></h3>
    <p>Design, Cultures, and Creativity (DCC) is an Honors program at the University of Maryland that focuses on using creativity and diverse ideas to explore emerging technologies’ multi-faceted impacts on society. I completed the program in 2016, but when my DCC mentor of two years invited me to come back as a teaching assistant the following year, I was ecstatic at the opportunity to stay so active in this wonderful community. I assisted in course design, as well as led weekly discussions and studio hours for two courses:
        <br/><br/>1) <strong>Introduction to DCC: </strong>a class that exposes freshman to creative thinking processes and the social implications of design through hands-on explorations, guest experts, and research journals.

</div>
    <p> <br/><br/>2) <strong>Time-Based Media: </strong>an arts-based class studying the history and social impact of time-based art through theory and practice.</p>

    <p>My main goal for the introductory course was getting the students to ask more questions: about themselves; about the biases and power structures around them; about the design flaws in our society. While I could’ve interrogated my students to the point where they question everything about life itself, that seemed artificial and downright sadistic--Instead, my strategy was to highlight the underlying core values of DCC itself: inclusivity and diversity. Each week, I facilitated discussion in a manner where every voice was equal, heard, and valued. With such diverse thought from my students, there was no doubt that their stories would naturally affect each other; make each other more aware of other perspectives; make each other ask more questions.</p>

    <h3>iD Tech | <em>Programming Instructor & Counselor, 2014 - 2015</em></h3>

    <div class="mediatext">

        <p>As a kid, the closest I ever got to summer camp was watching The Parent Trap on VCR in July. While I’m still a huge fan of Lohan’s timeless work, it couldn’t beat my experience leading a camp for two summers as a programming instructor at iD Tech.</p>
        <p>Each week, I had the opportunity to work with a group of eight high school students, teaching them Java and C++ programming through project-based classes. iD Tech trusts their instructors to create their own curriculums, so I spent my cumulative time of three months designing, and redesigning, my lesson plans. Every week, I had to assess each of my students’ skillsets within a few hours of meeting them, and then tailor my curriculum to an array of diverse capacities, learning methods, and interests.</p>
    </div><br/>

    <div class="mediatext">
        <img class="ui large right floated image" src="media/idtech_girls.jpg"/>
        <p>Throughout my first summer teaching, I became more aware of the social issues surrounding tech education: First, where are all the girls? Eight weeks teaching at the College of William & Mary, and the male-to-female ratio in my classes never exceeded 6 M : 2 F. Second, what happens to the people who can’t afford to learn? Computers, Arduinos, 3D printers--many technologies are expensive to work with, and that’s why iD Tech’s high camp fees mainly only attract affluent families.</p>
        <p>For my next summer at the University of Washington, I opted to teach at Alexa Cafe, an all-girls experience within iD Tech that focuses on social entrepreneurship and activism. Many of these girls also receive scholarships to attend through the camp’s initiatives to close the gender gap and digital divide. Even though we’ve still got a long way to go, it was inspiring to work with these girls to cultivate empowerment.</p>

    <div class="mediatext">
        <img class="ui large left floated image" src="media/idtech_pie.jpg"/>
        <p>At the end of the day, I wanted each of my students to enjoy their experience working with tech, even if that experience included me getting pied in the face by a 12-year-old. By the end of each week, I hoped my students walked out feeling the same way I did: that movies like The Parent Trap couldn’t possible compare to the real deal.</p>
